# Toronto-Bike-Sharing-Hourly-Prediction

This repository contains the work from a summer 2024 research project focused on applying machine learning techniques to predict bike-sharing usage in Toronto.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, developed and executed in Google Colab, that document the process from data acquisition to exploratory data analysis and model development for the project. A report summarising the methodologies, findings, and insights from this project is also available for review.
